a. Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Following are the requirements for getting the most out of Wifiphisher:

    * One wireless network adapter that supports AP mode. Drivers should support netlink.

Wifiphisher has been packaged by many Linux security distributions (including Kali Linux and Arch Linux). While these packages are generally quicker and easier to install, they are not always up-to-date. To install Wifiphisher package on Kali Linux you can type:
